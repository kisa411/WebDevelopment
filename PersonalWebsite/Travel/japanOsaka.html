	<h2> Summer 2016 - Japan, Osaka </h2>

	<p>I've always wanted to go to Japan for a long and slow-paced vacation ever since I visited Yokohama on a school field trip for a choir conference. Personally, Japan is one of those countries that I was just really interested in culturally because I grew up watching animes and reading mangas and I was intrigued by the historical and cultural aspects of Japan. Over the summer I spent 20 days in Osaka and Kyoto, during which I volunteered through Workaway <a href="https://www.workaway.info/">(link to Workaway here)</a>, a site where people can sign up to volunteer at host sites all over the world for a small yearly fee, and in return for 4-5 hours of volunteer work a day, five days a week, the host is expected to provide free housing and meals. I decided to do the trip through Workaway because it was a really cost-effective way to fund my trip but also a really great way to get immersed in local culture and have the slower-pace of traveling that I wanted. I also met some really wonderful and awesome people through the volunteer experience and overall am so happy that I was able to do the whole Workaway thing. I would definitely be interested in doing it again when I travel abroad soon!</p>

	<p>Anyways, Osaka is a city that's known for being the foodie center of Japan, since it has a lot of really great food options and a lot of tourists come to visit Osaka every year. I defnitely noticed this myself when I was in Osaka because I heard a bunch of different languages whenever I went outside my hostel - Chinese, Korean, English, Spanish, French, etc. For tourists, Osaka mostly offers a lot of shopping and eating options, but if you're interested in some of the more cultural things then Osaka definitely has some of those as well, as there are shrines and temples spread throughout Osaka that you can visit :). I personally thought that Osaka was so much more beautiful and exciting at night than at daytime, since the night cityscape is very beautiful and there are actually more people outside at night than during the day - the city is quite bustling with life at nighttime! :)</p>

	<p id="hostelsOsaka">Hostels I stayed at:<br>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://www.fourletterwords.xyz/about/">Four Letter Words Hostel</a> This hostel was very much just a place for sleeping, since each bed is partitioned off and it was a very quiet hostel. If you want a lot of privacy and a place to just retire for the night, then this hostel is perfect! The host was also really awesome and friendly and enjoys helping travelers figure out their itineraries or also just chatting about Osaka :). </li>
			<li><a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/8122166">Yuri's Place near Umeda Station</a> This hostel was really cute and everyone was really friendly, and it was more of a social hostel than the Four Letter Words Hostel. My favorite part about the hostel was its cleanliness and bright, open layout, as well as the super cozy and cute common area that made it really conducive for meeting other travelers :). </li>
