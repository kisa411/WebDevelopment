<p>Yesterday I finally arrived in Singapore after ~40 hours of traveling (flight time + layover time + general wasted time waiting in airport lines for security, etc etc - _ - )</p>

<p>Thankfully I have a friend who lives in Singapore, and his mom helped me out with all of the important things - phone, money, eZ link card (transportation card used for the subway and bus) and generally just helping me settle into my new dorm/hostel. I took a few pictures but I haven't figured out how to connect my phone to wifi yet so I can't upload them yet - here are some tips about settling in Singapore though! : )</p>

<p>Changi Airport: This airport was pretty crowded when I arrived, and although my flight landed around 4 pm going through security takes a while so if you're planning on having someone pick you up I would advise you to ask them to come at least 30 minutes AFTER your flight lands (ex. by the time I got out of security and found my checked baggage, it was already around 5 pm).</p>

<p>Phone: If you have a smartphone, I think it's easier to get a SIM card for Singapore telephone lines instead of getting a new phone altogether while you're here. SIM cards can be bought in most convenience stores; a couple common ones include 7-eleven and Cheers (this is where I bought mine). You can buy different pre-paid cards, and they each come with a certain amount of money already charged on the card. So for example, I bought a 15$ pre-paid card, and I think it should last me for at least a month. I'm not sure if you can charge (or "top-up" as they call it) a pre-paid card later after you've used all of the available balance on it, but I'll find that out later (hopefully I can haha). The pre-paid cards come with a local Singapore phone number that you can use while you're here, and it also comes with directions on how to configure data so that you can use the local data carrier.</p>

<p>eZ-link card: This is a card used for transportation purposes, such as the subway and bus system. Basically, you can buy it at any MRT station (which is what subway stations are called in Singapore) and you can charge a certain amount of money on it. Once you charge your card, you can use it to buy your way onto the subway or bus - it's convenient because you just tap the card on a machine instead of having to deal with cash/tickets. MRT prices are usually 0.80$ SGD ~ 2.50$ SGD, depending on how far you travel.</p>
