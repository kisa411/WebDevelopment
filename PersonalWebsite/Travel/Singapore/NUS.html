Ta-dahh~~! The National University of Singapore, the place where I'll be studying and spending my fall semester of junior year in! :)

Located on the southern side of Singapore, NUS is an extremely prestigious university that's famous throughout the world. I can't believe I'm actually getting the chance to study at this wonderful institution! I'm looking forward to meeting new people and taking advantage of all of the different opportunities NUS has to offer.

At NUS, the dorms are called halls of residence, student residences, or residential colleges, which is slightly different from how they're called at Notre Dame. It's amazing how much cheaper housing and meal plan rates are at NUS, especially when I compare them to the ones at Notre Dame.

Anyways, I was pretty fortunate to get on-campus housing as a non-exchange student, especially my first choice residence hall - King Edward II :) . It's pretty close to the Faculty of Science building, which is useful since I think that's where most of my modules (classes) will be held. It's also one of the more culturally-oriented dorms, which is nice because I really don't think I'm the type of person who'd be able to handle 4am jogging sessions and intensive sports, a couple of common dorm-activities in the more sports-oriented dorms.
