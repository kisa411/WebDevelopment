Fall semester - 2014 Singapore

<p>So this trip was the first time I've flown with Lufthansa, and I have to admit I actually really loved the whole experience!!! The stewardesses were super friendly and nice, and even though I totally had an oversized and overweight carry-on suitcase they were very nice about it and even helped me to put it in the carry-on stowage place. The best part of my flight to Frankfurt though was that the plane was pretty empty, which meant that I had three entire seats to myself : D That was really nice - I could just stretch myself out and actually sleep lying down using all three seats : )

My flight towards Singapore was also pretty awesome because I asked the flight attendant if I could change my window seat to an aisle seat instead and he placed me at the front of the section where the families with babies usually sit. Even though there were a couple of babies next to me, I really appreciated the extra leg room, especially since the flight itself was approximately 12 hours long. : )

Frankfurt airport is also a really nice place to have a layover because they offer cheap shower services, and a hot long shower can really hit the spot after an especially long flight :D I think it was ~10$ USD or 6 euros for a towel, shampoo, and a hairdryer : ), which is so much cheaper than the ~20$ shower service at Dallas-Fort Worth airport in Texas (and O'hare doesn't even have one).

Overall, one thing I learned during this entire trip was that German people are super nice and friendly!! I would love to go back to Germany to visit sometime, instead of to just pass through : )</p>
