<p>So today I went to the local hawker center (the one at Clementi) with my hall friend and enjoyed some real hawker food :) We also went shopping for some local fruits, such as starfruit, dragonfruit, passionfruit, and thai mangos (which are absolutely delicious!!) I was actually looking to buy some mangosteens as well, which I've heard are super yummy, but I haven't been able to find any so far - I did, however, find a stall that sold jackfruit so I tried that for the first time today and it was pretty good! Tastes kind of like cantaloupes except the texture is more stringy and firm - it's hard to describe what the different fruits here taste like so you should definitely just try them when you get the chance! :)

So now that I'm done with midterms and have finished most of the projects that are due this week, I've had some time to just relax :D I'm actually a little worried academically for my classes because 1) I don't know any of my grades for any of my classes except one, and 2) the one grade that I do know for one of my classes is my midterm grade that's worth 30% of the final grade and it wasn't very good :( . The professor told me not to worry too much about the individual grades since at the end of the semester they tend to curve grades according to a bell curve system, but I'm still worried that this semester's grades might affect my overall GPA, which wouldn't help in getting into med school :(

There's actually only 3 more weeks of classes left and then it'll be reading week! :) I'm going to Krabi, Thailand, for a few days during the week before reading week and then I'm planning on traveling through Malaysia for a few days before my first final exam. I will try to update with pictures and experiences from both trips! :)</p>
