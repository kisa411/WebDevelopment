<p>So this week is orientation week, which basically consists of one orientation session on Wednesday and registration on Thursday. Orientation back home is mostly focused on getting to know dormmates and other students in other dorms, but here the orientation was mostly logistical, with information about how to register for classes and university services that students might be interested in taking advantage of (health services, counseling, etc). My first day here I arrived in Singapore around 5pm, and I spent majority of the day figuring out what to do for my phone, getting a transportation card, and unpacking and settling into my dorm room. The second day was orientation day, and afterwards my host buddy and her friends took me and another exchange student who's in the dorms out for dinner to Clementi Street, a place famous for its hawker stalls : ) - I tried out Wonton noodles for the first time and although it was kind of spicy, it was still really good! I also tried durian for the first time and I don't know if it was because I just wasn'tÂ used to the flavor, but I didn't really like it - maybe it's an acquired taste? : / There were also other desserts like grass jelly and dried pork, both of which were super yummy : ))</p>

<p>The third day was registration, where we got our student ID cards - I thought I would end up having to wait for a really long time but the whole thing went by pretty smoothly and I was only at the registration center for 10 minutes max, haha. But because I went so early, I found myself with nothing else to do for the rest of the day so the other exchange student and I spent some time touring campus and figuring out how the shuttle system worked : ).</p>

<P>Today my NUS buddy promised to show us around the rest of the city for a while today along with the other exchange student, and I really should start taking pictures of the place so I'll try to take lots of pictures today and upload them! : )</p>
