<p>This weekend I'm visiting my hall buddy's house, who actually lives near Changi Airport! She has a brother who also goes to NUS but he actually commutes from home every day instead of living on-campus, but it's crazy to think about how he does it because their house is at least an hour away from NUS by public transportation o_0

The day we left school (Friday) there was a huge downpour and it was raining like CRAZY! I've never seen so much rain before but I guess this is what the locals meant when they said it really rains during monsoon season! Anyways, Friday was a pretty chill day since we left the dorm pretty late - we mostly spent the rest of the afternoon getting to her house and then doing some window-shopping at the mall at one of the stations (did I mention that in Singapore there's a huge mall in almost every single MRT station? haha). I was told that most Singaporean families don't cook at home since it's so cheap to just go outside to a local hawker center or food court and eat, and that's exactly what we did this morning - we went to this huge supermarket called "Giant" and ate breakfast at the food court, then went grocery shopping for a barbecue party later tonight! I haven't done so much grocery shopping ever since I came to Singapore, haha, but it was great! I love~~ grocery shopping :D

Tomorrow's the birthday of one of my hall buddy's little cousins so we're all going over to her grandparent's house to celebrate; it's really cool how her family spends a lot of time together since everyone lives in tiny Singapore - I get the sense that they're all really close :)</p>
