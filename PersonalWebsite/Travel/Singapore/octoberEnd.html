It's almost the end of October! There's a lot of halloween activities and parties happening in the next few days, both on campus, off-campus and around Singapore, and in the hall!

It's a little sad to think about October coming to an end though, because that just means the end of the semester is even closer than before. :(


I've made a ton of great memories and friendships here and I've been exposed to so many different kinds of people even though the semester has been pretty short. I've also learned quite a bit about myself and can do a lot of things that I wasn't able to do before, such as go to places by myself and not feel worried or anxious, really enjoy my free-time by trying new things or going to new places whether it's by myself or with other people, meet new people and have a great time by actually connecting with them instead of being the super awkward and shy girl that I used to be, and generally have an easier time spending time with people and enjoying their company.

To be honest, I'm not looking forward to going back to Notre Dame much because the one semester that I've had in Singapore so far has been so much better than the 4 semesters that I've had in Notre Dame. At Notre Dame I always felt like the time went by so slowly and that I would always have to make an effort to meet up with people or make/maintain friendships, but here it's not been like that at all; I don't know if it's because I feel like I actually belong in the hall here and am finding myself participating in more hall activities that I've ever done in my dorm back home,  or it's just easier to meet and make new friends because I'm on exchange and a lot of other exchange students are also looking to meet new people just as I am.

Either way, this semester's been great and so wonderful and if I could do it all over again then I definitely would. Also, this semester was my first time actually traveling to different places and experiencing the cultures, and it's given me a taste for traveling - is this the so-called wanderlust??? hahahahaha Whatever it is, I know that I'll definitely be going to other places in the future as well!! :D</p>
