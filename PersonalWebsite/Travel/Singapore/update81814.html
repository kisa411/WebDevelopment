<p>So many things have happened since the last time I updated my blog that I can't possibly write down everything, but I'll write down some tips for anyone that's thinking about studying at NUS/Singapore in the future!</p>

<p><strong>Registering for classes:</strong>

So the way exchange students register for classes here is different from the way local students register - local students are given a certain number of bidding points that they can use to bid for classes, but exchange students just list the classes they want to sign up for and if there's leftover spaces in the class then they're given a place in the course (referred to modules at NUS). There are also tutorials for most of the classes, and local students can sign up for which time slots they want online but exchange students have to manually go to the department of the module and register for tutorial slots there. If there's a class that you really want but didn't get in to, then you can appeal by using a APU form and if there's spaces that open up later then you can officially register for the course. :)</p>

<p><strong>Paying for housing:</strong>

I live in a dorm, so the system for paying for housing might be slightly different, but for me I got a billing statement around the 2nd week of August and I have 7 days to pay the bill. For my dorm, I can just go to the main office located in the main building of the dorm and pay the entire bill with my credit card - it's actually quite simple and easy! : )</p>

<p><strong>Food on campus:</strong>

There are a lot of canteens and food courts on campus so students have a lot of options for food. There are also lots of hidden cafes and kiosks that might be a little more difficult to find since they're a bit out of the way, but if you find one that you really like then it would be worth going there often, especially if they serve Western food (ex. Humble Origins, Ventus, Late Breakfast) or other things that you're craving ;). I know some students who just go around checking out all the different food places on days they don't have classes or have large gaps in between their classes, so that's always an option too! :)</p>

<p><strong>Going off-campus:</strong>

Going off campus is extremely easy due to the subway station (called MRTs here) that's conveniently located on campus (Kent Ridge station). Taxis are also quite cheap and there are also lots of buses that go through campus so it's really easy to leave school whenever you want to! Some places you might want to check out are Little India, Chinatown, Marina Bay/Bayfront, Orchard Road, Bugis, Holland Village, Botanic Gardens, and Labrador Park :D</p>

<p><strong>Going out of the country:</strong>

I haven't really been out of the country yet, but exchange students must first obtain their student's pass before they can leave Singapore. Don't worry about how to get your student's pass and stuff - they go through all of the steps on how to do that during orientation and stuff and everyone else is also getting theirs too at the same time so if you're ever confused you can just ask other exchange students :).

From what I've heard, going out of the country on weekend trips is really easy since Singapore is close to several different countries (ex. Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand). Some of the further destinations (ex. Vietnam, Hong Kong) you might want to reserve for longer breaks like fall break or reading periods (or even exam week if you finish exams early!)

If you ever have any questions about studying abroad in NUS or anywhere in general then please don't hesitate to ask/email me!! :))</p>
