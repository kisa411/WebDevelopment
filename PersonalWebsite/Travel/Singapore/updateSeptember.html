I can't believe it's already september!! I've already been at NUS for almost 7 weeks now and it's amazing how quickly time is flying by during my semester here - it's scary to think that soon midterms and finals will be coming up, but it's also sad to think about having to say goodbye to all of the wonderful friends and people that I've met at NUS so far :(

On another note, I feel like I've been here long enough to give a brief review of the classes and the teaching styles of professors, etc. etc. -

So compared to Notre Dame, the classes here are much more independent-study and it's basically up to the student to decide the amount of effort and work he/she wants to put into the class. A lot of the classes also don't have routine homework assignments or smaller-weighted exams; rather, most of the classes are based on one or two major projects/exams and maybe some of the tutorial grades (if the course has a tutorial). For most of my classes (except for one), it's entirely up to me to keep up with the class and do the readings and assignments.

Here's a link I found about the bell curve grading system that they have here at NUS :)

It's funny though because a lot of the local students here don't take exchange students very seriously because for them, when they go on exchange somewhere their grades don't matter whereas for me they do. So sometimes they're surprised to see me studying or doing anything remotely academic-related - one of my neighbors even asked me why I was staying in on Thursday night to study instead of going out and doing something else! (but then I explained that I still need to get good grades and she was like "ohhhh okay" haha).

On an unrelated note, I'M GOING TO BALI, INDONESIA IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS!!! It's a field trip for one of my classes (Balinese Theater), and we're going to learn how to perform Balinese theater for our major production at the end of the year, but I'M STILL SO EXCITED!!! The field trip is during the recess week (fall break) so I won't be missing any classes or other commitments, which is nice : )

I'll update soon again with lots of pictures! Â :))</p>
