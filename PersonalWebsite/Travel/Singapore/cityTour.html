<p>Yesterday was such a long but awesome day! There was actually a city tour organized by the exchange student organization at school on Saturday, but my friends and I didn't really have much to do on Friday so we decided to go see the city on our own! :)</p>

<p>We went to several tourist spots - Marina Bay Sands, Clarke Quay (which is actually pronounced Clarke Key, lol), Little India (where we had AWESOME dim sum - though I expected the dim sum place to be at Chinatown instead of Little India, but whatever it was still absolutely delicious &lt;3), the Botanic Gardens, and this massive shopping mall which I don't actually remember the name of but it was at the harbour front station (Singapore actually has a TON of malls! O_0 - apparently shopping is a very big thing here). I spent the entire day outside yesterday and am currently suffering from some horrible sunburns now TT ^TT - I really need to start being more generous with sunscreen and probably should buy a hat or something to protect my face, haha.</p>

<p>Today (Saturday) I wanted to get my hair cut and looked up some Korean hair salons (since I only like getting my hair cut in Korean ones) and found one at Orchard Road, which is another major shopping district in Singapore (so many shopping districts in this small country! lol) - the staff there was very friendly and although the haircut was a bit costly (70 S$ for a shampoo+conditioning, haircut, blow dry &amp; styling), I'm really satisfied and happy with the result - thus the reason why I only go to Korean hair salons! hahhaa</p>

<p>I spent a few hours afterwards looking around the mall and nearby area, got some bubble tea (which is super cheap here! usually around 1~3 S$) and even met a local student studying at NTU (one of the other universities near mine, NUS) and ate lunch together with her : )</p>

<p>Overall it was a great day! :))</p>
