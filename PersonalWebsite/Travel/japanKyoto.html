	<p>I absolutely, absolutely, <strong>absolutely<strong> fell in love with Kyoto!!! I loved everything about it - the casual and laid-back atmosphere, the super uber friendly people, the cultural richness of the region, the super bike-friendly nature of the city, basically everything about Kyoto! The only thing I didn't like about Kyoto was the disgustingly humid weather that sometimes made it really difficult to stay outside for too long, but otherwise everything about Kyoto was so wonderful!! I would love to go back and stay in Kyoto again if I could :))</p>
