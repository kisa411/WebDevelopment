	<h2> Spring 2016 - Mexico, Playa del Carmen </h2>

	<p>I've visited Mexico before, when I was in third grade, on a family vacation to Cancun, but since I was so young I don't really remember a lot of things from the family trip. Over spring break, my closest friends and I decided to go to Playa del Carmen for our senior year spring break trip, and it was SO MUCH FUN!!!!</p>

	<p>The start of the trip was a bit rocky, because we had an overnight layover at DFW airport before our flight from DFW to Cancun Airport, and our original Airbnb booking was so far from the main tourist area and the beach it was difficult to get to places without taking a cab everywhere. We quickly resolved the Airbnb situation by cancelling our stay at the first Airbnb and moving to a more central location (and also a place with better facilities) which made the rest of our trip substantially better.</p>

	<p>The first few days we explored the local areas and walked around the main touristy area which was full of really good restaurants and cafes, and since it was right next to the beach it was really easy to go to the beach whenever we wanted :))</p>

	<p>On the fourth day we went on a tour to the local Tulum ruins where we got to see the Mayan ruins of Tulum and also a ton of big lizards haha. The tour group also took us to Paradise Beach, which was a really beautiful beach complete with pure white sand and sparkling blue water you would normally see on a postcard! On the fifth day we were scheduled to go on a tour to a cenote, but we somehow missed the tour bus so we took our own transportation to a cenote. Cenotes are naturally formed freshwater pools that formed when the porous limestone bedrock collapsed, and they are filled with such clear water you can see all the way down to the bottom and see all the fish in the pool!</p>

	<p>Overall our trip to Playa was such a wonderful way to spend spring break and the week definitely felt too short - I would love to go back again sometime!!</p>
