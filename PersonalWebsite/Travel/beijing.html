Summer 2013 - Beijing, China
</header>

<body>
<p>This summer I went on a Beijing trip with my mom! We were debating between Japan and China, and on my dad's suggestion (he's been on a lot of business trips abroad), we chose to visit Beijing for our getaway :)</p>

<p>We decided to go on a tour since it was our first time going to a country where we didn't know the language, and in hindsight I think it was a pretty good decision to go with a group because it saved us the hassle of trying to find suitable accommodations and transportation. The weather was also great - not too hot and not too humid, even though it was in August.</p>


<p>Now for the pictures!:D</p>

<p>I don't remember the name of the hotel that we stayed at, but it was absolutely beautiful! There was a free complimentary breakfast buffet available every day and there was also this lovely pond full of lilypads just outside of our room. The rooms themselves were super clean and room service was very efficient - too bad I don't have any pictures of the actual interior of the hotel though : (</p>

<p>This statue was everywhere in Beijing - in restaurants, in stores, on the streets, etc. If I remember correctly, they stand for good luck and you touch them if you want some of their good luck to rub off on you Â :).</p>

<p>And now for the famous Tiananmen Square! :D The picture is kind of gray and hazy because of all of the air pollution in the city - mostly a combination of car exhaust and dust from the deserts. You can see the portrait of Mao Zedong in the background - The Tiananmen square was pretty interesting because I'd never seen such a large gathering/central square area before; my mom told me that Korea used to have one too before the government shut it down and built something else on top of it because of the excessive student demonstrations and governmental protests :/.</p>

<p>Now here was something interesting - a North Korean restaurant in Beijing! Now here's a good opportunity to clear up some misunderstandings: South Koreans DO NOT see and interact with North Koreans every day, contrary to what some people might think! Going to this restaurant was my first time actually hearing the North Korean dialect of Korean and I have to say it was kind of difficult to understand, because not only did they have different intonation and enunciation, they also sometimes used entirely different words for things (ex. like saying "apple" when they're talking about oranges).</p>

<p>The Great Wall of China! :D Thanks to our tour guide, we were able to go to a section of the wall that wasn't so crowded and full of people. This picture really doesn't do the wall any justice because it's much MUCH longer than the picture shows, but I'm sure you already knew that haha :)</p>

<p>Although the wall is surrounded by a tragic history, I still couldn't help but marvel at the architectural ingenuity and beauty of the wall - it was just so well made!</p>
