	<p>As a kid, I would go on a lot of road trips with my family all across the US, but we never traveled south to Texas. To be honest, I wouldn't really have been able to see myself living in Dallas before I made the move here, but so far my experience in Dallas has been pretty great! I really enjoy the laid-back atmosphere of the city and there are plenty of things to do in downtown and in the surrounding neighborhoods :).</p>

	<p>During my first week I spent most of my time organizing my apartment but also riding my bike around to different neighborhoods in Dallas. So far I've been to Deep Ellum, Bishop Arts, downtown, Lower Greenville, and Uptown. They all have their characteristics and cool places to hang out, but I think my favorite neighborhood is Uptown just because it's a great place for young professionals to hang out and the vibe is really fun :D.</p>

	<p>I'm not sure how long I'll be living in Dallas, but I intend to make the most out of my time while I'm here! :) </p>
