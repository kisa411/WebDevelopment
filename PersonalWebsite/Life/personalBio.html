	<div class="longBio">
	<p> I was born in Seoul, South Korea where I lived until I moved to Chicago in first grade. Since then I have moved around and lived in a bunch of different cities, including a couple of suburbs around Chicago, Portland, Irvine, Singapore, and Seoul. I currently live in Dallas, Texas.</p>
	<p>I graduated from the University of Notre Dame with a degree in Science-Computing, which is a fancy name for our intercollegiate degree combining Biology and Computer Science. Right now I work at <a href="http://callbox.com/">Call Box</a> in Downtown Dallas as a full-stack developer. I'm new to the tech-industry and am using my time at Call Box to learn as much as I can about everything development-related and also new technologies!</p>
	<p>When I'm not doing techie and development stuff, I love reading books, traveling <a href="..travel pages..">(check out my travel logs here!)</a>, trying out new restaurants and visiting new places <a href="..local life..">(keep updated with my local adventures :] )</a>, and watching movies & cartoons (my favorite genres are animation and thrillers). I'm really excited to start this blog and use it as a virtual diary of my life, and hopefully it can be helpful to others in some ways :)</p>
