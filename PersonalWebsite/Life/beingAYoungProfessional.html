	<p>Making the transition from being a student to a young professional has been a lot easier than I anticipated. I thought that I would really miss being able to take naps or have a more flexible schedule (i.e. skipping classes if I wanted to and sleeping in instead), or that work responsibilities might be overwhelming and kind of scary, but so far none of these things have really been true.</p>

	<p>One thing that I do really miss is being surrounded by people who are potential friends and being able to participate in clubs and group activities really easily. Now that I'm out of school and not living in a dorm or on campus anymore, I've found that it takes much more effort to meet new people and and actually hang out with them, not to mention sometimes I just like having a quiet weekend once in a while because I'm so tired from the work week.</p>

	<p>I'm getting more used to this lifestyle though and to be honest there are a lot of really awesome things about working - like earning money!!! This is definitely a really nice perk of working haha. I also like my job a lot, so going in to work has been actually kind of fun, and I'm learning so much every day on the job :D. I'm still definitely interested in going back to school for a master's degree sometime in the next several years, but for the time being I'll enjoy my professional life :))</p>
